KEY PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN
 
 
AE
RIAL IMAGING FOR AGRICULTURE THROUGH
 
NDVI
 
 
 
 

 
The Aim of the project was to 
evaluate 
the h
ealth of vegetation
. A 
digital camera was converted into an infrared 
camera
 
which was mounted on a drone
. 
Aerial p
hotos
 
clicked with 
the 
IR Camera were processed
 
using NDVI 
algorithm
 
and
 
the obtained 
images
 
d
e
termine
d
 
the health of the plant.


 
 

 
WIRELESS REMOTE FOR CANON CAMERA
 
 
 
 

 
A 
Wireless
 
R
emote
 
which can control all
 
functions of the camera such as Z
ooming in and out, clicking 
photo
s
, 
switching between video 
&
 
image modes etc. was developed.
 
Th
e
 
application 
was to control the camera from 
a distance
. 
For e.g.
 
C
amera mounted on a 
drone
 
can easily be controlled to capture Aerial images 
&
 
videos.

behavior of

was developed
.
 
This application helps us to find users of different social network sites 
&
 
analyze their 
behavior using different graph plots. 
For e.g.
 
Graphs between Like
s
, Com
ment
s
, Share, Follow etc. 
with respect to 
each other 
can be easily 
plotted
